## Day 6 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
   - A class is a sort of like an overall design or blueprint for a group or category. Things that everything in the group or category have in common.

1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?
   - Attributes are things or descriptions that each instance of a Class has. So if you had a Class that was House, an attribute would be something that every house has, like a door or a roof.

1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?
   - A behavior is what every instance of a Class is capable of doing. So if your class was Car, then every instance of a car has the ability to accelerate, break, or roll down the window.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors
   - Class = Dog
   - Attributes = Weight, Color
   - Behaviors = Wag tail, Bark

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
   - By adding an initialize method under a class and then calling the .new method when defining a new insance. The .new method points to the .initialize method we defined and creates the instance.

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
   - I'm sure that I'll have more the deeper we get into it, but I just wanted to make sure I understand why we use .new rather than .intialize when creating a new instance. Is it just because it's easier to read and shorter? Or is there another reason that I'm not seeing?
   - Also, it seems through the readings and exercises that instances are the same things as objects. Are these interchangeable, or is there a difference between the two?
